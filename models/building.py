class Building():
	"""A simple Building Energy Model.

	Consisting of one thermal capacity and one resistance, this model is derived from the
	hourly dynamic model of the ISO 13790. It models heating and cooling energy demand only.

	Parameters:
		* heat_mass_capacity:           capacity of the building's heat mass [J/K]
		* heat_transmission:            heat transmission to the outside [W/K]
		* maximum_cooling_power:        [W] (<= 0)
		* maximum_heating_power:        [W] (>= 0)
		* initial_building_temperature: building temperature at start time [℃]
		* time_step_size:               [s]
		* conditioned_floor_area:       [m**2]
